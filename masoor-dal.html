            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
               
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ghee </strong> -  known as liquid gold, this is clarified butter that is used as a main cooking fat in Indian cuisine. Itâ€™s so easy to make homemade ghee. </li>  
                    <li><strong>Cumin seeds</strong> -  whole cumin seeds rather than ground cumin give a nutty, warming flavor that is slightly sweet.</li>  
                    <li><strong>Yellow onion</strong> -  a base aromatic vegetable for the dal.</li>  
                    <li><strong>Plum tomato</strong> - adds a hint of sweet tomato flavor to the dal sauce.</li>  
                    <li><strong>Ginger and garlic paste</strong> -  aromatic ingredients that form the foundation of Indian cooking. Both ingredients add a kick of fresh flavor. Ginger paste and garlic paste are easy to make homemade.</li>  
                    <li><strong>Whole masoor</strong> -  also known as brown or green lentils. These lentils still have their husk which qualifies them as being whole.</li>  
                    <li><strong>Coriander & turmeric</strong> -  warming spices that add both a sweetness to the dal as well as an earthiness in flavor.</li>  
                    <li><strong>Kashmiri red chili powder</strong> - adds a beautiful red color and chili flavor with some heat to the dal.</li>  
                    <li><strong>Cilantro</strong> - a fresh herb that adds spicy and citrus flavors perfect for brightening the warm, rich flavors of the lentils.</li>  
                                        
                </ul>
                                 
            <h3>Instructions</h3> 

                 <ul>
                    <li>Set the Instant Pot to saute mode and heat ghee or oil. Add cumin seeds and cook until they start to sizzle about 30 seconds.</li>  
                    <li>Add onion, tomato, ginger, and garlic and saute for 2 to 3 minutes or until the tomatoes start to soften. You can use a non-locking lid to cover the pot to speed up cooking.  </li>  
                    <li>Add turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well.</li>  
                    <li>Add the masoor, water and give a quick stir. Close the Instant Pot lid with the pressure release valve to sealing and pressure cook for 10 minutes followed by 10 minute natural pressure release.</li>  
                    <li>Open the pot and stir in the jaggery. Add more water to bring the dal to the desired consistency.</li>  
                    <li>Cook on saute mode until the dal comes to a gentle boil. Garnish with cilantro.</li>  
                    
                 </ul>
                 <ul>
                    <p>Serve the Dal with white rice or brown rice that can be made easily in the Instant Pot.</p>         
                 </ul>
